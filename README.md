## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**    | The codebase follows a component-based architecture using React.js. It consists of reusable components for different sections of the website like header, projects, skills, etc. The components are composed together in the main App component to create the complete webpage. The codebase demonstrates a clear separation of concerns and promotes maintainability. |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The system relies on React.js as the primary framework for building user interfaces. It also utilizes other libraries such as tsparticles for particle effects and various CSS frameworks and utilities for styling and responsiveness. The codebase does not have many external dependencies, keeping the project lightweight and manageable.                         |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase exhibits good modularity with components organized in different files and folders. Each component is responsible for a specific task and can be easily reused or replaced as needed. The CSS styles are also separated into individual files, following a modular approach. The modularity allows for easier maintenance, testing, and extensibility.     |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**    | React.js efficiently handles rendering updates and optimizes DOM operations. The use of CSS animations and transitions can enhance the user                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control, utilizing branches for feature development and pull requests for collaboration. The use of Git allows for easy code collaboration, version tracking, and rollback if necessary.                                                                                                                                             |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The codebase leverages various integrations, including Google services such as Google Search Console and Google Analytics. These integrations help with website verification, monitoring, and analytics to track website performance. The codebase does not have direct integrations with external APIs or databases, functioning primarily as a static website.       |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The codebase's scalability depends on the chosen deployment strategy, such as utilizing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for caching and offloading assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
